# Awesome-adversarr
Awesome list for myself.

This page is WIP, and I do not think this is a proper classification.

## Study

- [Graphics Papers](https://github.com/GCL-Seminar/Awesome-Graphics-Papers)

- [siyuan](https://github.com/siyuan-note/siyuan)
- [ChatPaper](https://github.com/kaixindelele/ChatPaper)
- [Typst](https://typst.app/)

## Algorithms

### Think in ECS
- [ECS back and forth](https://skypjack.github.io)
- [entt](https://github.com/skypjack/entt): ECS for MineCraft, ...

### Spatial Data Structures

Recursive Spatial Subdivision:
- GPU: [Discregrid](https://github.com/InteractiveComputerGraphics/Discregrid)


## Programming

These libraries are used in my small  "engine", see `ACG`, `axes` for more details.

### CMake and its helpers

- cmake
- vcpkg

### C++ Basic

- [cpp reference](https://en.cppreference.com/w/)

### Fundamental Libraries

- abseil: Very Important, Useful library by Google.
- spdlog
- doctest
- nlohmann-json
- cxxopts?

### Math libraries

- Eigen
- glm

Note about `xtensor`: Does this library have a better performance in:
1. Compilation?
2. Runtime Efficiency: Cache friendly, alignement, BLAS, ...

### Parallel Computing

CPU:
- tbb
- taskflow

GPU:
- cuda
- compute shader
- OpenCL

## Graphics

### Basic GL Usage

GL:
- Vulkan
- OpenGL

Window manager and other utilities.
- `glfw3`
- `SDL`

### Utilities

- ImGUI
- tinyobjloader
